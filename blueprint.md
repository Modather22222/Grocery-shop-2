# E-Commerce App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and design for a modern e-commerce application built with Flutter. The app will provide a seamless and visually appealing shopping experience for users, featuring a clean and intuitive interface, robust navigation, and a focus on modern design principles.

## Style and Design

*   **Theme:** A modern and clean theme with a green accent color, inspired by nature and fresh produce.
*   **Typography:** The `Lato` and `Oswald` font families from Google Fonts will be used to create a clear and readable text hierarchy.
*   **Layout:** A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, with a focus on a mobile-first approach.
*   **Iconography:** Material Design icons will be used for a consistent and intuitive user experience.
*   **Imagery:** High-quality placeholder images for products and promotional banners.

## Features

*   **Splash Screen:** An initial screen that is displayed when the app is first launched.
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Sign-in and sign-up screens.
    *   Basic form fields for email and password.
    *   Navigation between sign-in and sign-up screens.
*   **Home Screen:**
    *   A promotional banner to highlight special offers.
    *   A horizontal list of product categories.
    *   Sections for "Featured Products" and "Best Sellers."
    *   A side drawer for navigation.
*   **Product Listing Screen:** A grid view of all available products.
*   **Product Detail Screen:** A detailed view of a single product, including its image, name, price, rating, and description.
*   **Routing:** A declarative routing system using `go_router` to manage navigation between screens.
